# <p align="center">A* Path Finding Algorithm for 2D Grid World
## AIM

To develop a code to find the route from the source to the destination point using A* algorithm for 2D grid world.

## THEORY
A* assigns a weight to each open node equal to the weight of the edge to that node plus the approximate distance between that node and the finish. This approximate distance is found by the heuristic, and represents a minimum possible distance between that node and the end.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Build a 2D grid world with initial state , goal state and obstacles

### STEP 2:
Create a class with the appropriate functions.

### STEP 3:
Build a 2D grid world with the initial state, goal state, and obstacles.

### STEP 4:
Mention its evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

### STEP 5:
The algorithm finds the best optimal solution.

Explain the Completeness and complexity of the algorithm:
This algorithm is complete if it guarantees to return a correct answer for any arbitrary input (or, if no answer exists, it guarantees to return failure).
The time complexity of A* depends on the heuristic.

## RESULT:
Thus, the algorithm finds the best path to reach the final goal using Informed (Heuristic) Search Strategies.
